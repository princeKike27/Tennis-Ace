# Tennis-Ace

For this project I analyzed data from the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). The goal is to create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the ATP data, I will be able to determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.
