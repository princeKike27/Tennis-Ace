# Tennis-Ace

For this project I analyzed data from the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). This data contains the top 1500 ATP players during the period 2009 - 2017. The goal is to create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the ATP data, I will be able to determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.

Throughout the project you will be able to find:

    Data cleaning and standardization.
    Analysis of the Correlation of Numeric Features.
    Scatter Plots of Relevant Features Vs Outcome.
    Creation of a Multiple Linear Regression Model to Predict Wins.
